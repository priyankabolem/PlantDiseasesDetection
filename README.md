A production-ready deep learning system for detecting plant diseases from leaf images. Features a custom CNN architecture trained on 38 disease categories across 14 plant species.

## 🚀 Live Demo

- **[🤗 Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/priyabolem/plant-disease-detection)** - Interactive Streamlit app
- **[📊 API Documentation](https://plant-disease-api.onrender.com/docs)** - FastAPI backend (Coming Soon)

## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time Disease Detection**: Upload a leaf image and get instant disease diagnosis
- **38 Disease Categories**: Covers 14 different plant species including tomatoes, apples, grapes, and more
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Get actionable treatment advice for detected diseases
- **Confidence Scores**: See prediction confidence levels for informed decision-making
- **Grad-CAM Visualizations**: Understand what the model is looking at (optional)
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low confidence predictions**: Ensure you're using good quality, well-lit leaf images
2. **Slow loading**: First load may take time as the model initializes
3. **Memory errors**: Try reducing batch size or image resolution
